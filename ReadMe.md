# FundMe

The `FundMe` contract is written in Solidity and allows users to fund the contract with Ether. The contract keeps track of the amount funded by each user and allows the contract owner to withdraw the funds and reset the funding amounts.

## Features

- Users can fund the contract with Ether
- The contract keeps track of the amount funded by each user
- The contract owner can withdraw the funds and reset the funding amounts
- The contract has a minimum funding amount, which is converted from USD to Ether using a price feed from Chainlink
- The contract has fallback and receive functions that call the `fund` function when Ether is sent to the contract

## Usage

1. Deploy the `FundMe` contract and pass in the address of a Chainlink price feed as an argument to the constructor
2. Users can fund the contract by calling the `fund` function or sending Ether directly to the contract
3. The contract owner can withdraw the funds by calling the `withdraw` function
4. Anyone can view information about funding amounts, funders, and owner by calling the view functions

## Functions

- `fund`: Allows users to send Ether to the contract. Checks if the value sent is greater than or equal to a minimum amount in USD.
- `getVersion`: Returns the version of the price feed.
- `withdraw`: Can only be called by the owner of the contract. Resets all funding amounts and transfers all Ether in the contract to the owner.
- `fallback` and `receive`: Call the `fund` function when Ether is sent to the contract.
- View functions: Allow anyone to get information about funding amounts, funders, and owner.

## Structure
- `Src/FundMe.sol`: This is the actual Solidity contract that is deployed to the blockchain. It contains the code that defines the functionality of the contract, such as the ability to deposit ETH, withdraw ETH, and check the status of the contract.
- `DeployFundMe`: This script is used to deploy the FundMe contract to the blockchain. It takes a number of arguments, including the target amount of ETH that needs to be raised, the address of the contract owner, and the address of the contract deployer.
- `Interactions`: This script is used to interact with the FundMe contract. It provides a number of functions that allow users to deposit ETH into the FundMe contract, withdraw ETH from the FundMe contract, and check the status of the contract.

## Usage
1. Use `DeployFundMe` to deploy the FundMe contract to the blockchain.
2. Use `Interactions` to interact with the deployed FundMe contract.
